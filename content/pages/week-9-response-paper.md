*The Challenge*: Researchers are incentivized to be first, not right. Agencies, such as the NIH and NSF, evaluated scholars on their publication records. This system incentivized researchers to exaggerate their individual contributions, and in the interest of competition, potentially hoard data and hide their mistakes. It might also have incentivized individual labs and researchers to work alone, even when collaborations could be better for scientific progress. How can we fix the incentives?

*The Tool*: Badges, transparency audits, openness metrics.

*Critical evaluation of the tool*.     

*This response paper should be about 1-page long, single-spaced. Total points: 3.*
