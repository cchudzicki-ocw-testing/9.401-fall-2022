## Doing science the way we aspire to do it.

There is no response paper due for this week. We will spend the first part of class time listening to presentations from the students taking the class for credit, and then have a closing discussion.

Challenge: Basic science does not generalize to the real world  
Discussion: What are we trying to achieve, again?
